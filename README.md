Good Evening, Seedling!

This is a narrative adventure game, where the player starts off as a seedling.

Depending on how scenarios are handled, the choices will determine what kind of tree the player grows into.

This is just a demo of the first scenario. It establishes the boilerplate upon which the rest of the game will be based on. The game logic is a work in progress as shown here:

ROADMAP
Patch 1: Code the loops for changing the stats block(year/season/growth/sturdiness)

Patch 2: With the code in place do the following:
    a. add the season change for p2.html so the fire event happens in summer
    b. do a scenario roundup; a non-interactive screen that shows your progress thus far and carries the user through to Year 1 Season Spring. The growth/sturdiness stats from patch 1 will be applied and shown at the one year mark

Patch 3: Apply the leaf dropping event that occurs in Year 1 Season Autumn
    a. text input for percentage of leaves to drop
    b. first potential death scenario (I'm nice, you'll get a warning)
    c. introduce the blight scenario for certain decision trees(hah, get it? TREES)

Logic and storyline will continuously be updated on the game's Figma flowchart, and as more decisions get solidified and worked out, the roadmap can expect updates
