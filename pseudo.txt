display area with flavour text
background colours that are springy
buttons - anywhere between 2 and 5(?)
    need to be in thier own divs so only applicable number shows
    styled in flexbox so they're on their own line and always centered
    need to find out how to change text depending on which scenario i am in....


h2 dynamic
    id blurb first will be flavour text about game
    id status second will show season and year

May 25/2023 status variables
xxxIs will always be the display variable

! yearIncrement is dependant on a different variable each iteration and doesnt change regularly
    rather than a loop with a regular increment, it must be dependent on something i declare
    for alpha, just set it to be 1 year
        this must be done per tree SO
decid progress = 1
conif progress = 1
unknown progress = 1
this engages when the tree choice(index) event listener is resolved, therefore this info displays on the next page(p2)

! seasonIs is the display variable
seasonChange is a loop that will cycle through a string array of the 4 seasons
p2 is year 1 spring, p3 will be year 1 autumn

! heightGrowth has different stats per tree
decid = +20 cm
conif = +1 cm
unknown = +100 cm

! strUp also has different stats per tree
IF THIS HITS 0 YOU LOSE
decid = +1
conif = +3
unknown = +2

! these variables must be pulled into the loop
add the variable, instead of the integer represented by the variable
this ensures when building further, modifiers can be applied to those variables
